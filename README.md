# AI-Robot

This small project was created for AI confarance on 7/8/2019.
Otto is a 3D printed robot that everyone can make (even without 3d printer) 
The perpose of this demo was to show how to combine a toy robot with Azure cognitive services.

If you want to create your own robot go to https://www.ottodiy.com/
I created a c++ program for the robot that you can use with your Arduino and upload it as is.
its importent to note that i used in my project an mp3 (mp3-tf-16p) insted of the buzzer that is in the original project.

In my Git you will find the Robot project file and the Python program that is using face recognition and detection.

For the Python project you will need to have CV2 installed
